# Mattynator
Mattynator-A The 1975 text formatter

## Description
Mattynator is a simple JavaScript program integrated in a HTML page that formats text input in The 1975 style 

"Hello" ====> "// H E L L O // L O V E"

## Use Cases
Mattynator was made as a simple project I made while I was getting started with JavaScript. It doesn't have a lot of use cases apart from being an interesting project to take a look at when starting to learn JavaScript.
You can download the Mattynator source code and adapt it for whatever project you are working on.
You can also re-do it on a different programming language, specially if you are a starter.
If you port it to another language you can always send it to me through the e-mail listed in the contacts section.

// H A V E F U N ! // L O V E
